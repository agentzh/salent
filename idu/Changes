v0.13 - 2005-08-26

* Created the repository.
* Merged the patch for asm2ast.pl provided by Sal to the repository. Sal++!
* Merged the Zhang Xing's work on gen_asm_tpl.pl, asm_tpl2.tt, and t\Disasm.t to the
  repository. Zhang Xing++!
* Updates to encoding.txt:
  Move
    ST(i) <- ST(0) / ST(i) 11011 100 : 1111 0 ST(i)
  from FDIV to FDIVR. Yeah, it should be fdivr.
  Move
    ST(i) <- ST(i) / ST(0) 11011 100 : 1111 1 ST(i)
  from FDIVR to FDIV. The same reason.
  Apply similar movement to FSUB*,
* jnc <=> jnb ? Weird.
* wrote debug.bat and debug2.bat to aid Disasm's test-driven development.
* Got a bug in Ndisasm! The operand size for FISTTP is completely wrong:
	'DF 4D 1C' => 'fisttp qword [ebp+0x1c]'
	'DB 8E 6C 07 A2 70' => 'fisttp word [esi+0x70a2076c]'
	'DD 0A' => 'fisttp dword [edx]'
* "fxch st1" should be abbreviated as "fxch" according to Intel's documentation.    
* At 20:24 on September 1st, Zhang Xing and I successfully achieved 100% of the
  test suit for our x86 disassembler, Disasm.
* Weird! pat_cover.pl failed to generate an instruction for pattern
	IMUL - memory with immediate to register
	0110 10s1 : mod reg r/m : immediate data
  in a run couple of days before.
  This bug haven't recurred yet. So I can't locate it.
* [TODO] Salent Assembler (SASM)
* [TODO] Salent Virtual Machine (SVM)
* [TODO] Bootstrap SVM by SASM and C
* [TODO] Verilog IDU
* [TODO] Perl MMU and C MMU
* [TODO] Perl IEU and C IEU
* Wrote state_mac.xml.tt to generate XML code for IDU's state machine AST. I expect Jack
  to render this stuff using Java's graphical capabilities.
* Wrote new_encoding_ast.pl to generate encoding2.ast, the next generation for
  encoding.ast. The main difference is that encoding2.ast contains NASM templates
  while encoding.ast doesn't. The structure of the new AST is completely compatable
  with the old one.
* Use encoding2.ast to replace encoding.ast in most cases, thus completing the
  "bootstrap" process for this AST.
* Add info for NASM syntax to encoding.html. Thanks to encoding2.ast!
* Add draw_graph.pl to produce PNG pictures (state_mac.png and t\state_mac.png) from
  the XML specs of state machines.


v0.12 - 2005-08-22

* Added debug code to cidu\Idu.pm, finding the maximal length of returned Perl code
  is 443 (thanks to t\chex2bin.exe.t and t\cbin2hex.exe.t!). Therefore it is
  appropriate to set the buffer size used by the dump_res_to_perl function to 512.
* Changed the value of BUFSIZE in dump_res_to_perl from 1024 to 512.
* Renamed the BUFSIZE constant to BYTES_LEN, expectedly to solve the naming pollution
  problem.
* Renamed the "cidu" folder to "C", which is more friendly. I look forward to more
  folders like "Java", "Verilog", "C#", "Python", or even "JavaScript".
* Added an awful lot of assertions to dump_res_to_perl in C\idu.c.tt. Although they
  make the C code quite ugly, I expect C IDU to be able to catch buffer overflow as
  soon as possible. Ugly but working solution.
* I failed to compile C\idu.c using CL.exe v13.00.9466 with /TP option. I got the
  following error message:
	idu.c(991) : fatal error C1061: 晤祒ん癹秶 : 輸И杶怮旮
  Damn! The good news is my tiny C IDU can be compiled by such CL.exe very happily.
* Sigh. CL v13.10.3077 still fails to compile C\idu.c with /TP option. I got the
  following error message:
	idu.c(989) : fatal error C1061: compiler limit : blocks nested too deeply
* Both gcc and g++ shipped with MinGW can perfectly compile C\idu.c. Whee!
* Early work on x86 Disassembler derived from our IDU has begun!
* Added fld_map subtree to global AST ..\Config.ast.tt. fld_map is a mapping function
  from the encoding of field to the corresponding name (or symbol). '000' => 'eax' is
  such an example.
* Created inc\Disasm.pm for Disassembler utilities
* t\Disasm.t added.
* Updates to encoding.txt again:
  Convert
    MOV -
	CR0 from register 0000 1111 : 0010 0010 : 11 000 reg
	CR2 from register 0000 1111 : 0010 0010 : 11 010 reg

  to
	  register from DR0-DR7 0000 1111 : 0010 0001 : 11 eee reg

  Remove redundant instruction 
	"MOV - register to SS 1000 1110 : 11 sreg3 reg",
  which is a special instance of
	"MOV - register to segment register 1000 1110 : 11 sreg3 reg".

  Remove redundant instruction
	"MOV - memory to SS 1000 1110 : mod sreg3 r/m",
  which is a special instance of
	"MOV - memory to segment reg 1000 1110 : mod sreg3 r/m".

  These modifications lead to 0 conflicted instruction patterns.
  Whee!
* Sal Zhong succeeded in refactoring the ram repository using Makefile mechanism,
  mimicing the way the alu repository follows. Sal++!
* Sal began to port the tester for ram to mmu.
* Wan Xunxin obtained an experimental implementation for mmu.v. Now he gets down to
  write tests for it. Xunxin++!
* Zhang Xing is now reparing NASM templates for our disassembler on idu. He is
  dangerously close to completion. I wrote inc\Disasm.pm.tt and a skeleton of
  t\Disasm.t for him. gen_asm_tpl.pl and asm_tpl2.ast.tt are produced by himself,
  getting help from me. Xin++!
* Cancel the unnecessary dependency in t\cidu.t on my XBase module. XBase is not
  mature enough for production.
* immediate date was incorrect for displacement: loopne, loope, loop, jecxz, enter, Jcc, and call.
  Actually, Ndisasm computes the absolute address displacement for CALL, Jcc, JECXZ, and so, with
  respect to the context. So a patch is needed for asm2ast.pl so as to fix this suttle issue.
* 8-bit level corrupts 16-bit displacement in the ENTER instruction.
* Our Disassembler now passed 48% of the tests in t/disasm_cover.t. Great!
* "nmake smoke" becomes popular again when we debug our Disasm implementation.
* Updates to txt2html.pl: line numbers added to the HTML output. Sexy indeed!
* Updates to encoding.txt:
  Convert
    ENTER 每 Make Stack Frame for High Level Procedure 1100 1000 : 16-bit displacement : 8-bit level (L)
  to
    ENTER 每 Make Stack Frame for High Level Procedure 1100 1000 : 24-bit displacement
  I made updates to inc\pat_tree.pm correspondingly. Thus multiple successive imm data section problem
  is solved simply by combining them into a whole. Simple and elegant!


v0.11 - 2005-08-18

* Improved the C IDU's error-handling mechanisms.
* Wrapped the C IDU as a Perl module named cidu::Idu with the same API as the pure
  Perl version inc::Idu. Thanks to the Inline::C module!
* Ported most of the tests for Perl IDU to C IDU and all tests passed! I saw
  how these two versions of IDU
  effectively shared the same tester front-end and most of the backend code.
* Added the "ctest" objective to Makefile.
* I was very excited to see the born of optest.tt.tt which is a TT2 template that
  generates another TT2 template! Actually, optest.tt.tt can generate different
  tester backend template for different versions of IDU. For example, to get
  optest.tt for Perl IDU, we should set "lang" to "Perl" via the tpage tool:
	tpage --define lang=Perl optest.tt.tt > optest.tt
  Another example is
	tpage --define lang=C optest.tt.tt > coptest.tt
  This scheme leads to the maximal code reuse of the tester backend.
* Ported pat_cover.t onto the C IDU land, reusing code by template-ize the original
  pat_cover.t as pat_cover.t.tt.
* Added the "cmintest" objective to Makefile.
* Refactored the tests for sub decode in t\Idu.t and t\cidu.t a bit.
  Now C IDU and Perl IDU share these tests via a template named opname.t.tt.
* Canceled the -d option and implemented 'set d' and 'unset d' for Perl idui,
  just as C idui.
* Got a potential bug in function dump_res in cidu\idu.c.tt: When parsing the
  instruction "f2 66 f7 46 0c 0c 01", we get the imm data "0c 00" instead of the
  expected value "0c 01".
* Added error.t.tt to the repository, in order to generate tests for error-handling
  mechanisms in Perl IDU and C IDU simultaneously.
* Updates to inc\Idu.pm.tt: used TT2 Macros to reduce redundant code.
* Commented out some debug code in pat_cover.pl
* Suppressed useless 66H prefix byte generation for instructions movsx, movzx, and
  bswap, leading to a satisfactory result that all the instructions generated by
  pat_cover.pl can be parsed correctly by Ndisasm.
* Added operand.t.tt to the tester, which can test the decoding result quite
  thoroughly. These tests are shared between Perl IDU and C IDU automatically.
* Added many more tests to t\error.t.tt. Thus the error-handling features of IDU are
  now thoroughly tested.


v0.10 - 2005-08-13

* From this version, the main focus was transisted to fix the LALR(2) and LALR(3)
  parsing problems in Idu.pm.
* Modified encoding.txt by hand [Convert LALR(2)/LALR(3) patterns to LALR(1)]:

* Bug fixes: hex2bin.c & bin2hex.c: When open binary files for reading or writing,
  it's necessary to use "b" as a suffix in fopen's mode string.
* Ndisasmw is able to dissemble "d5 0d" to "aad 0xd". Actually, NASM support
  "AAD imm" which is absent in Intel's table. I decided not to add "AAD imm8" to 
  encoding.txt.
* I decoded not to add "AAM imm8" to encoding.txt either.
* It's weird to handle the situation when "s" is 1 and "w" is 0. NASM doesn't
  support it at all, I think I should not either.
* Got a bug in sub parse_enc in pat_tree.pm: "port number" is now treated as
  "imm8 data".
* Got anothe bug concerning the immediate data length: sub parse_enc:
  "unsigned full offset, selector" means 4 bytes imm data for 16-bit operand size 
  and 6 bytes long for 32-bit operand size. So I introduce a new type of imm called
  'pointer' to the AST. I suppose it will work perfectly.
* Glorious News!!! It's the first time that all the tests get passed! Now it's
  22:30 August 13th, 2005. Here is the very output:
    perl -MExtUtils::Command::MM  -e "@ARGV = map glob, @ARGV; test_harness(

      Files=18, Tests=56245, 75 wallclock secs ( 0.00 cusr +  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU)

* Add support for "AAD ib" and "AAM ib". Excellent work! So now machine instruction
  "d5 1d" can be handled correctly.
* Recover general support for prefix byte 'f2' and 'f3'. So now machine instruction
  "F3 23 AA A3 C0 12 0A" can be parsed properly.
* Add missing x87 FPU instruction "FISTTP" to encoding.txt
    FISTTP - Store Integer with Truncation
    16-bit memory 11011 111 : mod 001 r/m
    32-bit memory 11011 011 : mod 001 r/m
    64-bit memory 11011 101 : mod 001 r/m
  So now machine instruction "DB 4B 1C" can get parsed.
* Got an unparsed machine instruction for ADD : 67 02 5C D9. Weird.
* Discard instruction "add bl,[si-0x27]" since CL don't accept it either. Maybe I 
  should ask my future MASM teacher.
* Now the test suit can be run arbitrarily without any failures. Yeah!
* No, when I add '66' prefix byte generation feature to pat_cover.pl, some tests
  failed.
* I suspect that Ndisasmw.exe incorrectly parse machine ins "66 A1 E8 1C 6B 88" to
  "mov ax,[0x886b1ce8]". Referring to Intel's doc, the instruction encoding should
  be "A1 MOV AX,moffs16". I think my IDU is right. 
* Yep, I'm now quite sure it's a bug in Ndisasmw.exe. CL.exe also generate
  "66 b8 e8 1c" for the assembly ins "mov ax,[0x886b1ce8]" where only 16-bit imm 
  data are accepted.
* Updates to encoding.txt:
  NOP instruction is now abandoned.
* CBW and CWD is now abandoned in encoding.txt. CBW and CWDE merged, and CWD and
  CDQ merged.
* Added support for successive prefix bytes in one instruction and introduce 
  'bits16' to the Idu decoding result. Hence, "f2 66 f7 46 0c 0c 01" should be
  parsed from now on.
* Important question: what does 'full displacement' stand for? Should it be 
  affected by the operand-size attribute set by the '66' legacy prefix byte?
  NASM thinks it is always 32-bit long regardless whether '66' prefix is present
  or not only for 'CALL'.
* Updates to encoding.exe according to the behaviour of NDisasamw.exe:
  Changed
    MOV - memory to AL, AX, or EAX 1010 000w : full displacement
    MOV - AL, AX, or EAX to memory 1010 001w : full displacement
  to
    memory to AL, AX, or EAX 1010 000w : disp32
    AL, AX, or EAX to memory 1010 001w : disp32
* According to NASM doc, I added Intel's one undocumented instruction "SALC" (d6)
  to encoding.txt.
* It is worth mentioning that the instruction "FCMOVcc" is missing in Intel's 
  Appendix B Table B-11.
* It is interesting to see that some instructions don't take 66 as a prefix bytes 
  according to Ndisasmw.exe. Here're several instances:
    movsx ecx,bp
    movzx ebx,di
    bswap edx
* Began the work on cidu. I found that testing the C code using Inline::C is
  amazingly convenient!


v0.09 - 2005-08-11

* Got another error in Intel's "IA-Manual-2B.pdf": FSTCW should be FNSTCW and 
  FSTSW should be FNSTSW. FSTENV, FSAVE, and FCLEX are other examples.
* The following instructions may not be parsed by Idu.pm properly:
    POP - 000 sreg2 111
    DEC - 1111 111w : 11 001 reg
    DEC - 1111 111w : mod 001 r/m
    INC - 1111 111w : 11 000 reg
    INC - 1111 111w : mod 000 r/m
    FADD - 11011 d00 : 11 000 ST(i)
    FDIV - 11011 d00 : 1111 R ST(i)
    FMUL - 11011 d00 : 1100 1 ST(i)
    FSUB - 11011 d00 : 1110 R ST(i)
  and many more LALR(3) patterns (such as JNS)...
* Remove "LOCK - Assert LOCK# Signal Prefix" from encoding.txt


v0.08 - 2005-07-31

* Merge Sal's ram tester and his two idu tester front-ends cod2ast.pl and 
  pe2ast.pl to this version.
* Found a bug in PEDasm. It incorrectly translate "f7 9d" to "neg ebp". Both 
  Ndisasmw and my idui.pl suppose this is an invalid machine instruction.
  And so do I. So I force pe2ast.pl to ignore this.
* Got another! PEDasm translates "f7 5d" to infamous the "neg ebp" instruction 
  as well.
* PEDasm fails to distinguish "NOP" from "XCHG eax,eax". Got it fixed in optest.tt
* Makefile-ize the idu repository.
* Migrate Pugs'wonderful "smoke" mechanism to Salent idu.
* The hyper-links in smoke.html now compeletely work. The links on the test file
  name are pointed to the test script source, and the links on the colored bricks
  are set to the corresponding line of the AST file. Excellent!
* The link-setting code added to util/testgraph.pl is now fully optimized.
* The tester is also optimized by setting the evironment HARNESS_OK_SLOW to true. 
  Good news! 


v0.07

* First run exe2t.pl using my little bin2hex.exe, 311 tests of 24192 total tests 
  (1.29%) failed. In other words, 98.71% passed.
* I fixed a "new-line bug" in exe2hex.pl, so all "MOV reg, imm" passed, leading to
  the passing rate of bin2hex.exe.t of 99.03%.
* After I modified the optest.tt a bit, the test passing rate raised to 99.36% 
  (155 tests failed).
* I cancelled the REP prefix (F3h) in Idu.pm.tt, thus "REP MOVS", "REP OUTS",
  etc., will be decoded properly.
* When I fixed the most of the synonym problems, bin2hex.exe.t passed 99.45% 
  (133 tests failed).
* Adapt to NASM's "es ..." and "db ..." syntax, thus giving rise to a passing rate
  of 99.51% (119 tests failed). It is interesting to noting that PEDasm generate 
  "byte ..." pseudo instruction for unrecognized instrucitons, but NDisasm prefers
  "db ...".
* "insb" is a synonym for "ins" when the w field is set to 0.
* NOP and XCHG shouldn't break but they broke. I rewrite the sub sort_next_states
  in state_mac.pm using the algorithm based on equivalence class grouping. The
  original algorithm is incorrect in theory. This modification gives rise to 
  a test passing rate of 99.64% (86 tests failed).
* I asked Sal to provide a new tester front-end based on PEDasm.exe.
* Ignore prefix byte f0 to make the LOCK instruction available. I have no idea
  how I can fix it. Leaving it to a TODO test may be best choice for now. Sigh.

* Instruction CWD and CDQ conflicted. Reserved the former only.
* Instruction CWDE and CBW conflicted. Reserved the former only.
* Typo in Intel doc: "UD2 - ... 0000 FFFF : 0000 1011". It should have been "1111",
  but it is "FFFF". Sigh. Thanks to sub parse_enc!
* Typo in Intel doc: "IMUL - ... 0000 1111 : 1010 1111 : 11 : reg1 reg2". It should
  be "11 reg1 reg2", not "11 : reg1 reg2". Thanks to sub parse_enc!
* I made a decision to support all the FPU instructions in the Salent Instruction 
  Decoder.
* Typo in Intel doc(Appendix B): the FINIT directive lacks encoding pattern. Well,
  it's not a typo, FINIT is a combination of two separate instructions (FWAIT and
  FNINIT)
* Missing instruction FNINIT in Table B-33, Appendix B.
* ASCII ' - 'appeared in FPU instruction 'FLDL2E'.
* So many typos in Table B-33! Intel--
* It is critical to sort the next state list for each state according to their 
  patterns' relative generalities.
* What is the length of the "immediate data" if the "w" field is not present in
  the instruction encoding? The PUSH and SUB instructions give different answers.
  So perhaps I could say "uncertain" or such.
* What is the length of the "port number" in
  "IN - fixed port - 1110 010w : port number"?
  Should it be "immediate data", or "imm8"?
* What controls the length of "immediate data"? only "w"? only "s"? or both?
* I'm guessing that the len of "immediate data" is 8-bit if both "w" field and
  "s" field appeared and they are both set to 1. In other cases, The len is 
  determined absolutely by the "w" field: 8 when "w" = 0 and 16/32 when "w" = 1.
  If the "w" field is absent, the len is determined absolutely by the "s" field:
  8-bit when s = 1, 16/32-bit otherwise.
* There is a serious problems concerned with CALL, INC, and DEC. The first byte's
  patterns conflict. I can do nothing but split the encodings for DEC and INC.
